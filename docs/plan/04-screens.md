### Use Case B: The Production Sprint
*   **User:** Production Lead.
*   **Goal:** Execute 3 global shoots for PFW in 14 days.
*   **Journey:** Pull **Shoot Recommendations** based on trend momentum -> Use **Intelligence Booking** to sync with Studio A (Milan) -> **Neural Link** auto-notifies collaborators Elena & Marcus.
*   **Outcome:** 14% reduction in logistical spend via AI resource optimization.

### Use Case C: The Omnichannel Guardian
*   **User:** Social Media Manager.
*   **Goal:** Maintain 100% brand consistency across Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest.
*   **Journey:** Upload assets to **Media Board** -> **Guardian Agent** flags lighting deviation in 2 frames -> **AI Editor** suggests caption adjustments for "Ethical Epicurean" persona -> **n8n Automation** pushes to scheduled queue.
*   **Outcome:** Zero aesthetic drift across 12 unique platform touchpoints.

## 3. Deep Dive: Gemeni 3 Tool Utilization

### 3.1 Reasoning & Thinking (`gemini-3-pro-preview`)
Used for **Strategic Pivot Alerts**. The model doesn't just see a trend; it "thinks" through the implications for the brand's 50-year heritage, identifying if a trend is a flash-in-the-pan or a fundamental shift in luxury consumer behavior.

### 3.2 Real-time Grounding (`googleSearch`)
Powering the **Market Signal Feed**. This ensures FashionOS is never "hallucinating" in a vacuum. It cross-references brand data with live reports from Business of Fashion, Vogue Business, and WWD to provide grounded advice.

### 3.3 Cinematic Synthesis (`veo-3.1`)
Transforming **Production Briefs into Cinema**. Instead of moodboards, Creative Directors receive 1080p cinematic vignettes that accurately reflect the lighting, fabric movement, and atmosphere of a proposed shoot.

### 3.4 Multi-modal Live (`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio`)
Enabling the **Hands-free Production Link**. During a shoot, a photographer can speak to the OS to check if the current frame aligns with the DNA pillars without putting down the camera.

## 2. ADVANCED AI FEATURES (V2 — NEURAL AUGMENTATION)

### 2.1 Autonomous Lookbook Architect
- **Concept**: Turn a folder of raw shoot frames into a finished editorial lookbook.
- **Tech**: `Gemini 3 Pro` + `Structured Output`.
- **Action**: AI analyzes the "Approved" assets in the Media Board, selects the best 20 based on DNA compliance, and generates an InDesign-ready JSON layout with heritage-aligned captions.

### 2.2 Live Sentiment Pulse (Runway)
- **Concept**: Real-time social listening during a live event.
- **Tech**: `Gemini 3 Flash` + `Google Search Grounding`.
- **Action**: The Intelligence Panel streams a "Vibe Score" during a show, analyzing IG/X mentions to tell the designer which look is trending 4 minutes after it hits the runway.

### 2.3 Sponsor ROI Simulator
- **Concept**: Proactively predict the value of a sponsorship contract.
- **Tech**: `Gemini Thinking` + `Google Search`.
- **Action**: Sponsorship Managers input a contract value. AI simulates reach based on the current "Trend Velocity" of the sponsor’s sector (e.g., Luxury Auto) and the Maison’s current momentum.

### 2.4 Voice-to-Task (Backstage)
- **Concept**: Hands-free operational management for high-pressure show moments.
- **Tech**: `Gemini 2.5 Native Audio`.
- **Action**: A dresser says: "Concierge, Look #12 has a broken zipper, notify the tailor node." AI creates a high-priority task and pings the relevant team member immediately.

### 2.5 The Aesthetic Digital Twin
- **Concept**: A virtual brand representative that "reviews" campaign concepts.
- **Tech**: `Gemini 3 Pro` (Recursive Thinking).
- **Action**: Designers upload a "Moodhallucination." The AI "Digital Twin" performs a deep reasoning session to identify if the concept will alienate the "Silent Curator" persona or if it correctly pushes the brand into a "Brutalist" pivot.
